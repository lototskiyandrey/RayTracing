# Raytracing Project

## Introduction

So back in a previous class our professor has us write a raytracer by following along the contents of Peter Shirley's [Raytracing in a Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/). This ended up being one of my favorite programming projects
that I've done, since my first experience programming was with something called [Processing](https://processingfoundation.org/) which is basically a "software sketchbook". Processing allows you to make cool little programs such as games and artistic programs. To me the assigned project felt like a continuation of my experience with Processing. Eventually, I came back to this project, and have since completed the next book in the Raytracing series. The code here currently (18/5/2025) is almost exclusively from the textbook and is not my own. However, I plan to extend this code to include additional features, such as volumetric lighting, new primitive shapes (triangles), and eveutally refactor this entire repository to use CUDA to dramatically speedup the render time of scenes.
